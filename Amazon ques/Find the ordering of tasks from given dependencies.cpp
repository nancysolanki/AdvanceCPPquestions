// consider this problem as a graph (related to topological sorting) problem.
//   All tasks are nodes of the graph and if task u is a prerequisite of task v, we will add a directed edge from node u to node v. Now, this problem is equivalent to finding a topological 
// ordering of nodes/tasks (using topological sorting) in the graph represented by prerequisites. If there is a cycle in the graph, then it is not possible to finish all tasks (because in 
// that case there is no any topological order of tasks). Both BFS and DFS can be used for topological sorting to solve it.

// Since pair is inconvenient for the implementation of graph algorithms, we first transform it to a graph. If task u is a prerequisite of task v, we will add a directed edge from node 
// u to node v.

// Topological Sorting using BFS
// Here we use Kahnâ€™s algorithm for topological sorting. BFS uses the indegrees of each node. We will first try to find a node with 0 indegree. If we fail to do so, there must be 
// a cycle in the graph and we return false. Otherwise we have found one. We set its indegree to be -1 to prevent from visiting it again and reduce the indegrees of all its neighbors by 1.
//  This process will be repeated for n (number of nodes) times.




// CPP program to find order to process tasks
// so that all tasks can be finished. This program
// mainly uses Kahn's algorithm.
